# hello-world

Hi all, my name's Robbie von der Schmidt, and I do most of my work in Python, R, and C++. I graduated from Princeton in 2020 with a bachelor's in Evolutionary Biology and a certificate in Finance, and my coursework in both disciplines pushed me to heavily leverage machine learning, programming, and data science.
